# Spring_2022
UCI Spring_2022 Python for Data Analysis
# Course Overview
Welcome to the UC Irvine 2022 Spring Onlinecourse Python for Data Analysis! We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems.

In this program, we will use Python to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. Specifically, you will learn how to:

Define many of the approaches and considerations that data scientists use to solve real world problems.
Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools in Python.
Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
Communicate data driven insights to peers and stakeholders in order to inform business decisions.

# What You Will Learn
Statistical Analysis with Python:
Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries and tools.
Data-Driven Decision-Making:
Define and determine the trade-offs involving feature selection, model accuracy, and data quality.
Visualizations & Presentations:
Create visualizations and interactive notebooks to present to industry stakeholders.

# Python Version
The curriculum materials for this course are written in Python 3.6. The material is compatible with Python 3.7.

# Lesson Schedule
Here is the schedule we will be following for our part time data science course:

# Flex Topics
Flex sessions are designed to provide the class with time to catch up, review materials, ask questions, work on projects, or go deeper into specific topic areas.

Depending on class interest, we may optionally cover additional topics, such as:

# Project Structure
This course will ask you to complete a series of projects in order to practice and apply the skills covered in-class.

## Unit Projects
At the end of each Unit, you'll work on short structured projects. These activities will test your understanding of that unit’s most important concepts with in-class practice and instructor support.

For those of you who want to go above and beyond, we’ve also included stretch options, bonus activities, and other opportunities for further reading and practice.

## Final Project
In our final project, we'll ask you to apply your skills to a real-world or business problem of your choice.

This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your life, industry, or organization. You’ll create a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

Proposal: Describe your chosen problem and identify relevant data sets (confirming access, as needed).
Brief: Share a summary of your initial analysis and your next steps with your instructional team.
Report: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.
Presentation: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.
